# Sidney High School Spanish Club

This is a makeover of the Sidney High School Spanish Club website, because the old website was just way too heavy. This time I am utilizing the power of SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.

SvelteKit will be my framework to handle the front-end, routing, and SEO.

TailwindCSS will give me the power of CSS without all the hassle. It has dark mode support, responsive classes, etc...

I am hoping this project would turn out better than the last one.
